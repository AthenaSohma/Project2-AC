Heading down its wooden, strangely unkempt stairs, it's dark as you descend but light enough to see around you. It appears to be a personal medical room, however it's been stripped of any tools and the like. Hey, are you okay? Are you seeing things?</div>

            Robert Walton, on a voyage to the North Pole, rescues Victor Frankenstein, who shares his tragic story. Victor, driven by a desire to unlock the secret of life, creates a monstrous being, only to be horrified by its appearance and actions. The creature, seeking companionship, demands Victor make another like him but is refused. In retaliation, the creature kills Victor's loved ones, leading to a cycle of revenge and tragedy. As Victor pursues the creature into the Arctic, both Walton and Victor die, leaving the creature alone to lament his existence before seeking his own demise in the icy wilderness.
