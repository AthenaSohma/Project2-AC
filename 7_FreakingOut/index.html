These notes pique your interest every time you stumble on one. A black wire hanging from their belly buttonâ€¦ and as a last attempt, using a vacuum to get it out. Horrifically disturbing. You feel uneasy at the thought, but decide to keep looking around.</div>

            The narrator discovers a thick black wire-like object protruding from their belly button while drying off after a shower. Despite initial attempts to remove it with tweezers, the object continues to emerge, causing discomfort and panic. As they try various methods, including spinning the tweezers and pulling on the object, they eventually feel a popping sensation and realize it is attached to a pinkish veiny tube. Desperate to remove it, they consider using a vacuum cleaner to suction it out, feeling increasingly distressed and unsure of what the object is or how to handle it.
