        <div class="narrative">The study is tidy with a shelf full of neatly organized books and a board with notes. Whoever was here must've liked to think. They left a node on the desk… writing about universal nodes, that the universe is a simulation somehow, and it's going to lead us to our doom. Simulation speculation… what a weird concept.</div>

            In the future, the discovery of Universal Nodes leads to the realization that the universe may be a simulation. Despite risks, attempts are made to deactivate these Nodes. When successful, parts of the universe vanish, revealing the simulated nature of reality. Exploration expands as more Nodes are deactivated, leading to the discovery of planets with artificial life. However, deactivating a fifth Node unexpectedly leaves behind ruins, challenging the understanding of reality. Questions arise about the true nature of existence and the consequences of tampering with it.
