            A retired police officer reflects on the loss of his wife, Sarah, to illness five years ago. Despite his devastation, he focuses on caring for their daughter, Madison, who is now six years old. Madison shows signs of her mother's illness, including frightening episodes where she resembles Sarah and exhibits unusual strength and behavior. The officer struggles with his grief and fear, particularly as Madison's condition worsens. In a moment of clarity, Madison asks to be memorialized with her mother's full name. Unable to bear the pain any longer, the officer contemplates ending their lives together, hoping to spare their daughter from suffering the same fate.
