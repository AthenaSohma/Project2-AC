With just barely enough light coming from the strung Christmas lights, the attic appears full of bones and blankets. Someone was here before you, orâ€¦ maybe many, many more. The note on the floor is a story of someone who lived in this house. They discovered this before you did. </div>

            As a child, the narrator lived in a peculiar tall and narrow house filled with oddities like multiple fireplaces, a small backyard, and a unique dumbwaiter system. Eventually, due to its age and the high costs of maintenance, the family had to move. While packing, the narrator discovered a previously unnoticed attic entrance in the roof. Curiosity led them to explore, where they found the attic was illuminated by old Christmas lights and set up as a living space. However, the most unsettling discovery was piles of bones, some burnt, with apologies scrawled on the walls. This revelation left the narrator shaken, realizing that the attic had been above their bedroom for years without their knowledge.
