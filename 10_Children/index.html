        <div class="narrative">Stumbling through the cornfield, there's an opening with yet another note creepily in the centre. You go forward and read the note. It tells the story about a cult of children who murdered and sacrificed adults. When you finish with the paper, you put it back where you found it. As you leave, you can't help but hear rustling in the corn around you followed by slight giggling, in the corner of your eye you do spot a figure. It's like they know something you do not.</div>

        <div class="dialogue">"Are those children back there..?"</div>

            It follows a couple, Burt and Vicky, who stumble upon a deserted town in rural Nebraska where all the adults have been gruesomely murdered and the children rule under the leadership of a sinister figure named Isaac. The children worship a malevolent entity called "He Who Walks Behind the Rows" and sacrifice adults to it. Burt and Vicky must fight for their lives against the murderous children and the supernatural force that controls them. The story explores themes of religious fanaticism, the corrupting influence of power, and the primal fear of children turning against adults.
