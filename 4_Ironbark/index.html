However you think nothing much of it, you expected some sort of paranormal thing to happen here. That's the reason you came here. The note reads of another cult in the area.

            Jack Nelson takes on a summer job as a fire lookout in Ironbark State Park, encountering strange occurrences and mysterious disappearances. He befriends fellow lookout Connor Hawkins, but unsettling events, including screams in the night, an eerie visitation, and encounters with a suspected cult, drive Jack to fear for his safety. Despite attempts to seek help, his concerns are dismissed by authorities and his manager. Jack ultimately escapes the park, vowing never to return and warning others to beware.
