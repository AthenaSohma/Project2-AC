The car physically looks fine, but upon closer inspection it looks like it had broken down and whoever left it is now long gone. There appears to be a noteâ€¦ looks like they wanted out of here asap.

            After a gaming convention, teenager Holly Gardner takes forested back roads to avoid traffic. At a gas station, she's warned to avoid a girl in a gown. Later, her car breaks down, and she hitches a ride with a man named Jason to a motel. At the motel, strange events unfold: she encounters a man in her room, is drugged by coffee, and experiences unsettling encounters. She narrowly escapes an aggressive intruder with the help of the motel manager, Joe. Despite suspicions of a cult or drug ring, Holly leaves the town safely, vowing to avoid road trips in the future.
