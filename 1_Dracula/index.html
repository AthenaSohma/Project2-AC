            Jonathan Harker travels to Castle Dracula in Transylvania to conclude a real estate transaction with Count Dracula. Despite warnings from locals, Harker finds Dracula initially hospitable but soon realizes he's a prisoner and the count is diabolical. In England, Harker's fiancée Mina Murray and her friend Lucy Westenra face strange occurrences, including Lucy's mysterious illness and eventual death, attributed to vampirism. With the help of Professor Van Helsing, they uncover Dracula's evil deeds and pursue him to Transylvania, ultimately destroying him and his vampire brides to save Mina and rid the world of his menace.
