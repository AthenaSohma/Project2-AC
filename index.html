        <div class="narrative">You were born a curious, adventurous soul, so when you heard about this seemingly abandoned house and its surrounding area, you felt no choice but to investigate. Afterall, you’ve been an avid horror podcast listener, not to mention an aspiring supernatural investigator. You’re here for a good time, not a long time. It has been known to have housed many different people and families over the years, but they’ve all either died, disappeared, chose to move away, or got lucky. You've heard stories that range from cults, folklore, to personal experiences, but do you really know what you're doing?</div>
