        <div class="narrative">Just beyond the car, there's a somewhat large body of water surrounded by pine trees. The water is eerily still and not a footstep in sight, just the light rustles of grass that accompany you. Again, another note randomly sitting in the grass, as if waiting for you to pick it up. La Llorona… let's hope she's not actually lurking here. You’d better leave.</div>''

            Ramon encounters a homeless woman in Vancouver who reminds him of a childhood ghost story about "La Llorona," a woman who drowned her children and roams in search of them. Despite dismissing the tale, Ramon becomes increasingly disturbed by encounters with the homeless woman, whom he nicknames "Llorona," as she asks about her children. Memories of his impoverished upbringing in Potrero, Mexico, resurface, along with fears of the supernatural. Struggling with his past and present, Ramon confronts the eerie presence of the homeless woman and ultimately finds himself embracing her in the rain, blurring the lines between reality and the ghosts of his past.
